# AI Vision Batch Processor

This command-line tool processes a batch of PNG images and sends them to an AI vision model (OpenAI or Google Gemini) to transcribe or analyze their content. The motivation is to avoid manually copying images and prompts into ChatGPT or other tools, especially when there are many pages to process. There may be similar tools out thereâ€”if you find a better one, let me know I will gladly switch to using that!

## How to Transcribe a Batch Set of Images

1. Make sure [Deno](https://deno.land/) is installed.
2. Prepare a folder with images you want to process. **Supported formats**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP, and BMP.
3. Prepare a prompt file (or passs using `--prompt` directly if its one line and short)
4. Have an OpenAI API key ready.

> Permissions are restricted to reading from `./images`, writing to the current directory, accessing environment variables, and making network calls only to `api.openai.com`. Thanks to Deno's cool permissions model!

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
deno run \
  --allow-read="./images" --allow-write="./" --allow-env \
  --allow-net=api.openai.com --allow-net=deno.land \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bra1nDump/llm-batch-image-transcription/main/main.ts \
  ./images --output output.md --prompt-file default_prompt.txt \
  --provider openai --model gpt-4o
```

## Output Format

The tool produces a markdown file with each image's transcription appended. In "detailed" mode, each image is prefixed with a markdown header (like `## filename.png`), followed by the AI-generated text.

```markdown
## image1.png

[Transcribed text from image1]

## image2.png

[Transcribed text from image2]
```


## Features

- Supports multiple AI providers:
  - **OpenAI** (GPT-4 Vision)
  - **Google Gemini Vision**
- Smart image preprocessing:
  - Automatic resizing (768px on the short side, up to 2000px on the long side)
  - JPEG compression with size checks
- Flexible output formatting:
  - Configurable separators or headers for each image
  - Insert detail headers, custom text, or no separator
- Debugging support:
  - Save preprocessed images for verification
  - Detailed logging and progress updates
- Batch controls:
  - Process entire folders or limit to N images
  - Sort images by filename for consistent ordering

## Development

You should just start the project with the .vscode/launch.json from your Run and Debug panel.
